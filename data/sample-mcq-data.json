The **extensor digitorum** extends the fingers at MCP but does not flex MCP nor extend IP via the extensor hood mechanism the way intrinsics do. The key is that *loss of intrinsics* (lumbricals/interossei) produces MCP hyperextension with IP flexion — think \"intrinsic minus = claw\".",
        "correct": "✅ Correct — the **interossei and lumbricals** are the intrinsic muscles that normally *flex the MCP* and *extend the IP* joints. When they are paralyzed, unopposed extrinsic extensors hyperextend the MCP while extrinsic flexors flex the IPs, producing a claw. Great recognition — remember: intrinsics = MCP flexion/IP extension (Mnemonic: \"I ntrinsics F lex MCP, E xtend IP\")."
